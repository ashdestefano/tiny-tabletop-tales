# Vargouille Infestation

* Challenge Rating: 3
* Difficulty: Medium

## Summary

The party arrives in a small hamlet just as it is attacked by a Vargouille bent on infesting the townsfolk.

## Description

The party arrives in the village in the evening to find that its only major features are a half dozen homes, the general store, and the tavern
which doubles as a town hall.

In the tavern, the party meets the town drunk, a rowdy and ugly man who lacks in charisma. He tells them many drunken stories, 
such as how he was kissed by a winged beauty in the woods earlier that day. He looks gruesomely ugly and the other townsfolk are convinced he's sick and send him home.

The following morning, the townsfolk are awoken to screams of alarm to find that the drunk man's head has been ripped off in the night,
and his corpse left slumped against a wall. Depending on whether the party endeared themselves of the villagers the previous evening,
they may be accused of the crime.

At this point, two vargouille inhabit the village. For each day that the party takes in solving the mystery and then clearing the infestation,
the vargouille have a chance of making more of their kind. However, they also have an increased risk of exposure. Roll on the below table for
each day the party is in the village to determine whether the true threat is exposed.

* Day 2: Roll a 1d6, on a 1 or 2 the vargouille are exposed. The number of vargouille increases to 4 by the next day.
* Day 3: Roll a 1d8, on a 4 or lower the vargouille are exposed. The number of vargouille increases to 6 by the next day.
* Day 4: Roll a 1d10, on a 6 or lower the vargouille are exposed. The number of vargouille increases to 10 by the next day.
* Day 5: The vargouille are exposed no matter what. The number of vargouille is now 15.
