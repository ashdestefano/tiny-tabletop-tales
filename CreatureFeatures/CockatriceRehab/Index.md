# Cockatrice Rehab

* Challenge Rating: 1
* Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Summary

The Emerald Enclave wants to introduce a male cockatrice raised from a hatchling to a wild female.

## Description

The Emerald Enclave wants to hire the party for a conservation effort. They are offering each party member 10 gold apiece (Persuasion DC 15 for 15 gold apiece) to
deliver a male cockatrice that has been raised at a sanctuary to a female in the wild, and help him in the mating ritual. Their hope is that the male's comfort with
humanoids will be passed on to the offspring, and result in less cockatrice attacks in the wild, which will save the endangered species.

They have also asked the party to attempt to bring back any unfertilized cockatrice eggs, in the hopes of studying the species.

## Treasure

10GP per player, or 15GP if they persuaded the Enclave for better pay.

The cockatrice den also contains 50GP worth of gems.
