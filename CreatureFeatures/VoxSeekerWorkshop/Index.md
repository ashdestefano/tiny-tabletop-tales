# Vox Seeker Workshop

* Challenge Rating: 1
* Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Summary

A toy maker's workshop has gone haywire, all of the machinery is running out of control, the lights are flickering on and off and disorienting anyone who enters. Four [vox seekers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vox-seeker) have escaped from their docking clamps and are nesting on the ceiling, and on their turn will move toward the nearest creature who has spoken in their vicinity.

## Description

When the players enter a small town, they are approached by a non-binary person in a grease-stained artificer's clothes, as if they have just left their shop. The half-elven engineer introduces themself as Weylan. They explain that they recognized the party as a group of adventurers, and needs a job done that the town constable is under-equipped to handle.

They go on to explain that they are a toy maker for the children in this and the neighboring towns, and have a fairly lively trade in building magical constructs that roll, walk, climb, and fly. However, one of their spells went awry, causing a small explosion in the workshop, and in the smoke and confusion they were attacked by one of their constructs, but couldn't see well enough to tell which one.

Weylan wants to offer the party a bounty to capture or dismantle any constructs that might be harmful, but adds that for every toy that is destroyed, they will not be able to pay out as much gold due to the loss of materials.

When they arrive at the workshop, the party will find that the building is mostly constructed of sturdy stone and resistant to fire, but the main workshop floor is shrouded in smoke and flashing lights. It's also in complete chaos, with the workshop floor covered in a variety of constructs (described in the combat details section).

## Combat Details

Due to the smoke and flashing lights in the shop, the entire workshop area is lightly obscured. If any of the constructs marked as explosive are destroyed, the area will become heavily obscured for one minute. Opening the bay doors of the garage to the south and using any spell or effect that blows the smoke out of the workshop will reduce the obscurement from heavy to light or from light to none, once per round.

Four of the constructs in the workshop are [Vox Seekers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vox-seeker). They are blind, but have a blindsight of 60 feet and will move in a straight line toward the nearest character who has spoken within that radius.

A large number of gyros and other minor constructs move at random about the shop. These constructs have 1 HP, and an Armor Class of 12. For the sake of simplicity, you can break these down into four groups, and have them move in a specific initiative order.

DM's NOTE: None of the constructs described below are combatants. The movement of these constructs is intended to distract and disorient the players, making it difficult to tell them apart from the real aggressors, the vox seekers. They are also all designed to look frightening and weaponlike.

### Group 1

**Initiative 15:** Four constructs that look like tanks move 20 feet straight toward a wall, rebound off of it, then move straight in a random direction. If any of these are destroyed, they explode. Any creature within 5 feet of the explosion must succeed a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d2 damage. Each explosion also causes the smoke effect described above.

### Group 2

**Initiative 12:** Three constructs that look like humanoids walk 15 feet, changing directions randomly every 5 feet.

### Group 3

**Initiative 8:** Three batlike constructs 20 feet directly toward a random creature, swoop down at the creature's head, then change directions and head for a new creature.

### Group 4

**Initiative 4:** Five spider constructs crawl 15 feet away from any creatures. If any of these are destroyed, they explode. Any creature within 5 feet of the explosion must succeed a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d2 damage. Each explosion also causes the smoke effect described above.

## Treasure

Weylan pays the party 1gp for each construct that they rescued and contained, and 2gp for each Vox Seeker that was successfully contained rather than destroyed.
