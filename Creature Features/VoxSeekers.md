# Vox Seekers

##### Difficulty: Medium

## Summary

An engineer's workshop has gone haywire, all of the machinery is running out of control, the lights are flickering on and off and disorienting anyone who enters. Four vox seekers have escaped from their docking clamps and are nesting on the ceiling, and move toward the last person who spoke on their turn.

## Treasure

Bronze clock parts totalling 5 pounds in weight apiece, valued at 3gp for the complete parts, or 50sp for the raw materials. The original creator will pay a reward of 5gp to have his parts returned.
