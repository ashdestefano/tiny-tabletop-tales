# Dom's Complete Encounters

Welcome to Dom's Complete Encounters! This is a collection of encounters I've crafted for D&D 5th Edition, that will provide the full experience of presenting an encounter to your party, complete with creatures, flavor text, and even maps!

## But Y Tho?

One of the things I've noticed in the campaigns that I run is that my players completely destroy combat encounters that are supposed to be their CR level, without expending themselves too much. Just looking at monster stat blocks didn't seem to be enough to present challenges to my players. So it occurred to me that if I design an environment specifically for that encounter, and genuinely challenge my players to solve problems in ways that go beyond just rolling attack and damage dice, I may be able to appropriately reflect the challenges presented by the creatures.

To that end, these encounters will have detailed "living maps", and simplified instructions for DMs to run encounters that will be engaging and challenging, without being frustrating and tedious or simply throw a slew of enemies at the party.

## Tips

* Stick to encounters with a challenge rating equal to the average level of your party. These have been crafted to be a "medium" challenge for a party of that level, which means that they shouldn't be able to complete the encounter in just a couple of rounds of combat, but they also won't be at a significant risk of a party wipe.

* These encounters are built with battle maps in mind, and are not optimized for "theater of the mind" play. Very rarely will there be more combatants than there are party members in each encounter, however there may be a lot of non-combatants, or environmental effects that happen at different stages of the battle, and it will be easier for your party to visualize these effects on a map.
